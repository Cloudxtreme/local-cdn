# local-cdn

A node module for serving up concatenated javascript and css bundles in local development servers,
and generating compressed bundles for deployment to a CDN for production installs.

It can work standalone along side another web framework, or be embedded inside an existing node
project as [Connect Middleware](http://senchalabs.github.com/connect/).

The goal of local-cdn is to make it easy to build web app with a CDN in mind from Day 1, rather
than having to hack in this step later on.

Here's a good article on the Yahoo Developer Network explaining 
[why using a CDN is important](http://developer.yahoo.com/blogs/ydn/posts/2007/04/high_performanc_1/).
